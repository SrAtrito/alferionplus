# Alferion App

This application generates technical and commercial proposals using a Word template.

## Installation

Install the required Python packages before running the application:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `docxtpl` package is necessary for creating the proposal document, and
`openpyxl` is required to export Excel reports. If any of these packages are
missing, they can be installed individually:

```bash
pip install docxtpl openpyxl
```
